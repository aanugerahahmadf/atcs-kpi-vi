GitHub Push Instructions
========================

To push the notification system changes to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have a Personal Access Token (PAT) from GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub.com
   - Click on your profile picture → Settings
   - Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Generate new token with "repo" permissions
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again)

2. Push the changes using your token:
   git push https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/aanugerahahmadf/atcs-kpi-vi.git main

3. Alternatively, you can set up your credentials:
   git config --global credential.helper store
   git push origin main
   (You'll be prompted for username and password - use the PAT as password)
