4. `.message-card` - Proper spacing and layering
5. `.conversation-item` - Better interaction targets

## Technical Implementation Details

### Z-Index Management
- Header: z-index 10 (unchanged)
- Main content: z-index 1
- Dropdown button: z-index 10
- Dropdown menu: z-index 1000
- Message actions: z-index 2

### Responsive Design
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Desktop (1024px+): Two-column layout (conversation list + message area)
- Proper spacing at all breakpoints

### Visual Improvements
- Enhanced scrollbars for better visibility
- Improved hover states for interactive elements
- Better visual separation between components
- Consistent spacing throughout the interface

## Files Modified

## Testing

The fixes have been implemented to ensure:
- No overlapping elements
