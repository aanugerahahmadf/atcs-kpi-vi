- Data export functionality for all entities

### 5. Admin Panel
- **Filament Resources** ↔ **Models** ↔ **Repositories**
- Complete CRUD operations with Bxs icons and navigation groups

## Testing Connections

All system connections have been verified:
- ✅ Navigation links work correctly
- ✅ Authentication flows function properly
- ✅ Data displays correctly in all views
- ✅ API endpoints return expected data
- ✅ Streaming functionality operates as expected
- ✅ Map integration works with live data

## Next Steps

The system is now fully connected and ready for use. All components work together seamlessly:
- Users can navigate from the welcome page to any feature
- Admins can access the full management interface
- Real-time features (streaming, mapping, notifications) are operational
- Data flows correctly between all system components
