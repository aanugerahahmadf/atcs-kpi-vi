See `MESSAGING_SIZING_FIXES.md` for detailed information about all sizing fixes applied.

## Test Linter Issues

### False Positive Errors
The Intelephense linter shows false positive errors on the `actingAs()` method calls in `tests/Feature/MessageFunctionalityTest.php`. These errors can be safely ignored as:

1. The code pattern matches exactly with other test files in the project
2. `User::factory()->create()` correctly returns a User model instance
3. User models implement the Authenticatable interface as required
4. The tests will run successfully despite the linter errors

See `MESSAGE_TEST_FIXES.md` for detailed information about the test linter issues.

## Routes Added

- `GET /messages/conversation/{user}` - View conversation history with a specific user

## Database Schema

The messages table includes:
- `from_user_id` - Sender of the message
- `to_user_id` - Recipient of the message
- `body` - Message content
- `subject` - Optional subject line
- `type` - Message type (default: "message")
- `priority` - Message priority (default: "medium")
- `read_at` - Timestamp when message was read
- `archived_at` - Timestamp when message was archived

## Testing

Run the feature tests with:
```
php artisan test --filter=MessageFunctionalityTest
```

## Usage

### For Regular Users
1. Navigate to the Messages page
2. Select a recipient from the conversation list or dropdown
3. Type and send messages
4. View conversation history
5. Delete messages using the delete button
