# Message Functionality Test - Linter Issues

## Problem
The Intelephense linter in VS Code is showing false positive errors in the `MessageFunctionalityTest.php` file:
- `Undefined method 'assignRole'`
- `Expected type 'Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable'. Found 'Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection<int, Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model>|Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model'`

## Explanation
These errors are false positives and do not indicate actual problems with the code:

1. **assignRole method**: The `assignRole` method is provided by the Spatie Permission package's `HasRoles` trait which is used by the User model. The method exists and works correctly.

2. **Authenticatable type**: The User model extends `Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User` which implements `Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable`. The linter is not properly recognizing this inheritance chain.

## Solution
The tests will run successfully despite these linter errors. The code follows the same patterns used in other working test files in the project.

## Verification
To verify the tests work correctly, run:
```bash
php artisan test --filter MessageFunctionalityTest
```

All tests should pass without any actual errors.
